        <div class="infotext"><p>My name is Omer and I am recent electrical engineering graduate from McMaster University.
            I love almost all aspects of electrical and computer engineering and am especially keen on
            RF electronics, microelectronics, programming, and control systems. In my sparetime, I
            like to work on my own electronic projects with microcontrollers and read up about the video
            game industry.

        <div class="experience">
            <h2>Callisto Integration (2018 - 2019)</h2>
            <p>Between May 2018 and August 2019, I had the opportunity to work as a Controls Engineer at
                a company called Callisto Integration. Here I was able to learn about the manufacturing automation industry
                 and develop skills is coding with ladder logic for PLC devices. I have been a part of projects from start to
                 finish, from the development of the Factory Acceptane Testing documents to comissioning the actual
                 software on-site.</p><p>

                 In addition to developing SCADA and PLC software, I also wrote several Python and VBA scripts as needed to generate
                 and filter through large data sets. Additionally, I've been exposed to applying cybersecurity measures to
                 a manufacturing setting as I was in charge of analysing the different hardware on-site, highlighting potential vulnerabilities,
                 and suggesting appropraite mitigation strategies.</p><p>

                Examples of software and technology I have experience with in those role include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>RSLogix 5000</li>
                <li>Modsoft 84</li>
                <li>Unity Pro</li>
                <li>ArchestrA Suite</li>
                <li>Intouch</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>VanWyn (2017)</h2>
            <p>
                During the summer of 2017, I completed my first co-op as an electrical engineering student at a start-up
                engineering company, VanWyn. Tasked with assisting the proof of concept of wireless power transfer for a
                minimal viable product, I conducted research into the topic of microwave power tranmission. After consulting
                with professors and industry professionals, I was able to design, simulate in MATLAB, and create antennas capable of
                transmitting power via electromagnetic waves.

            <h2>Fall-Safe</h2>
            <p>As my final year engineering capstone project I, along with 3 of my colleagues, designed and created
                a home analytics/monitoring device. This device, Fall-Safe, is meant to be worn at the waist by elderly
                people who have a high risk of falls or if a medical professional would like to obtain information about their
                day-to-day movement.</p><p>

                Fall-Safe when worn will collect information regarding the users speed and mobility and relay that via bluetooth
                to a nearby basestation. The base station will use a machine learning algorithm to compute the users current state
                of movement and detect any falls. All this information can be accessed remotely by a concerned third-party (loved one or
                health-care professional) through the Fall-Safe web app, in a user friendly and easy to understand format. In the event of
                a fall an alert will pop up on this app alerting those appropriate.</p><p>

                See below for a video showcasing the device, how it works, and a demo:
